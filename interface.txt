Note (Jun. 26): I'm more than likely going to make most of the interface using JavaScript through browsers. For example, the inventory interface is going to be a runtime-generated table holding pictures that are also links of all of the items. These pictures have mouse-over tooltips (onload JS event), can be drag & dropped in many different ways and are just more flexible in every aspect.
